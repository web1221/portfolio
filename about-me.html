      <p>I was born and raised in a suburb outside of Washington DC, called Silver Spring, Maryland. I dropped out of high school at the age of 16, and applied to my local community college. I attended the community college for a couple years where I studied criminal justice. The deeper I went into the courses, the more I realized this path wasn't for me. I've worked a few different jobs; I've delivered pizza for dominos, I've worked for my family's cleaning business, and in 2018 I moved to Portland, OR and found a job making ribbon racks for the military. I started getting interested in programming in early 2019. I've had several family members who have worked with, or around, computer programming and coding. It really seems like a career that can fuel my passion for problem solving, and is also going in the right direction with the times. I started trying to self-teach a bit, but with a full 40-hour-plus work week it was hard to find the motivation needed to make strides self-taught. I would feel like I was progressing, and then would hit a wall that seemed to throw me back to the beginning. That's when I started looking at coding-specific schools. I was looking for something that would push me to code while getting human-to-human contact. Epicodus seem to have everything I was looking for, along with a part-time program that would really help me gauge my interest in coding. So far Epicodus been an amazing tool, and has really helped me with concepts I didn't even know I was missing!

      <h3>Interest</h3>
      <p>I'm really interested in animals, I love being around them, and helping animals in need. I have rescued a decent amount of animals; a few cats, one pregnant cat, a dog, a few rabbits. Some have stayed with me, and others have been adopt to good homes. The moment I see a domestic pet wandering the streets, I am hitting the pavement to try and find out if it is lost, and how it can be returned. I also like to keep up with what is going on in MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). I enjoy watching events, and occasionally attending them.

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Driving</li>
        <p>I love going on drives and exploring new places. I have driven across the country five times. Those 5 include a 10,000 mile trip around the country, a trip from Maryland to Seattle and then back, and lastly my move to Portland. All of these are filled with amazing memories and adventure.</p>
        <li>Camping</li>
        <p>The first time I went camping I was 16 and absolutely fell in love with it. Being in the outdoors for the weekend can really sooth the soul. It's very calming, and challaning at times.</p>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <p>Hiking is also a fun way to push yourself with an amazing reward at the end. Being in the PNW with all the oppertunity and beautiful scenary it's hard to not making hiking a hobby!</p>
        <li>Watching TV</li>
        <p>We are in the golden age of TV and it shows. There are so many great shows out there that I like to try and keep up with a few. It is fun to have an occasional binge and completely immerse yourself in the story!</p>
